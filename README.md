Linear Regression Analysis and Multiple Regression Analysis Predicting value of response variable when predictor Variable value/Values are given


Linear Regression can be represented by the simple following equation

y=ax+b
where b and a are coefficients
x is a predictor variable
and y is a response variable

this equation can be represented on a graph with a straight line

y changes as x changes

However in Multiple regression, y depends on many predictor variable
Multiple regression equation can be represented by following equation

y = a+a1x1+a2x2+a3x3....+anxn
x1,x2...xn are the predictor variable
as they change, value of y changes

a,a1,a2...an are called coefficients
x1,x2,x3,....xn are the predictor variable
and y is a response variable
